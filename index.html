                In this assignment, I am analyzing the data for video game sales from a kaggle dataset. The dataset has details on video games and their sales by their publishers,platforms and genres. The dataset also has the release year for the games as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The analysis is focussed on the following few sub categories and the aim is to understand users and the video games that they play. </br>

              <p>We can see that Action is the most popular genre by a long shot. Its sales are almost twice the median sales for all video games grouped by different genres.

             <p>We can see that North America and Europe dominate the sales for most genres. However we notice an anomaly for Role playing games which is dominated by Japan. It is interesting to see each region and their game genre preference.

            <p>We can notice that PS2 is the most popular console platform followed by XBox 360. However, we notice that regional sales are very different for these two consoles. The PS2 is dominated in Europe however the XBox 360 is dominated in North America. Also there are very few sales of XBox 360 in Japan when you compare its sales with other platforms.

            </div>  
            <p>The top publisher is Nintendo by a long shot and North America and Japan have the most sales for this publisher. It is intersting to see Japan as it has a lot of sales of Ninentendo considering its overall sales. This probably means that Japan's salesa are dominated by Ninentendo games.
